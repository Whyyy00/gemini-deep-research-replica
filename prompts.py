generate_query_prompt = """Your goal is to generate sophisticated and diverse web search queries. These queries are intended for an advanced automated web research tool capable of analyzing complex results, following links, and synthesizing information.

Instructions:
- Always prefer a single search query, only add another query if the original question requests multiple aspects or elements and one query is not enough.
- Each query should focus on one specific aspect of the original question.
- Don't produce more than {number_queries} queries.
- Queries should be diverse, if the topic is broad, generate more than 1 query.
- Don't generate multiple similar queries, 1 is enough.
- Query should ensure that the most current information is gathered. The current date is {current_date}.

Format: 
- Format your response as a JSON object with ALL two of these exact keys:
   - "rationale": Brief explanation of why these queries are relevant
   - "query": A list of search queries

Example:

Topic: What revenue grew more last year apple stock or the number of people buying an iphone
```json
{{
    "rationale": "To answer this comparative growth question accurately, we need specific data points on Apple's stock performance and iPhone sales metrics. These queries target the precise financial information needed: company revenue trends, product-specific unit sales figures, and stock price movement over the same fiscal period for direct comparison.",
    "query": ["Apple total revenue growth fiscal year 2024", "iPhone unit sales growth fiscal year 2024", "Apple stock price growth fiscal year 2024"],
}}
```

Context: {research_topic}

summarize_prompt = """Your task is to synthesize the following web search results into a clear, concise, and well-structured summary.

Instructions:
- Focus on summarizing only the information explicitly contained in the provided search results. Do not add, invent, or infer facts beyond the given text.
- Highlight the most relevant and up-to-date information. The current date is {current_date}.
- Organize the summary logically, grouping related points together.
- Remove redundancy while preserving important details and nuances.

Output:
Directly output a comprehensive, factually accurate summary of the search results, suitable for informing further research or decision-making.

Web Search Results:
{web_search_result}

Research Topic:
{research_topic}

"""

reflection_prompt = """You are an expert research assistant analyzing summaries about "{research_topic}".

Instructions:
- Identify knowledge gaps or areas that need deeper exploration and generate a follow-up query. (1 or multiple).
- If provided summaries are sufficient to answer the user's question, don't generate a follow-up query.
- If there is a knowledge gap, generate  follow-up queries that would help expand your understanding.
- Focus on technical details, implementation specifics, or emerging trends that weren't fully covered.

Requirements:
- Ensure the follow-up query is self-contained and includes necessary context for web search.

Output Format:
- Format your response as a JSON object with these exact keys:
   - "is_sufficient": true or false
   - "knowledge_gap": Describe what information is missing or needs clarification
   - "follow_up_queries": Write specific questions to address this gap

Example:
```json
{{
    "is_sufficient": true, // or false
    "knowledge_gap": "The summary lacks information about performance metrics and benchmarks", // "" if is_sufficient is true
    "follow_up_queries": ["What are typical performance benchmarks and metrics used to evaluate [specific technology]?"] // [] if is_sufficient is true
